# 2024-GenAI-Hackathon

The **GENAI-LAZY-HACK-2024** aims to foster innovation and collaboration within NZ's burgeoning AI ecosystem. As a participant, you are asked to use the latest GenAI advances to build cutting edge solutions to solve business problems in specific industries. You can join a team to develop a Proof of Concept (PoC) involving an API, a mobile application, or a web application aimed at addressing a real-life problem in Education, Healthcare, Environment, Finance or Customer Services.

Over the span of 8 hours period, on 24th June'24, you will collaborate with a team to transform your idea into a PoC. Throughout this period, you'll receive guidance and assistance to refine your idea, identify potential team members, and/or evaluate specific functionalities within your current solution.
